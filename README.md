# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
This is our first project with Machine Learning.\
In this project, we use a dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders to build a model for fraud detection task. It's collected and handled by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).\
We just use some data imbalance handling techniques (Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE) and some basic Machine Learning models (k-Nearest Neighbours, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classification, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes) and choose the best method that meet our criteria.\
In this case, the best data imbalance handling technique is Undersampling and the best model is Logistic Regression.
